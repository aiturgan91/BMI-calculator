## Project Overview
The BMI Calculator is a simple desktop application built using JavaFX. It allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) by inputting their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters). Once the user enters their data and clicks the "Calculate BMI" button, the application computes the BMI and displays the result along with a classification (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese). This project demonstrates basic JavaFX UI components, event handling, and BMI calculation logic.


## how to work?
The application starts by launching the Main class.
The Main class loads the FXML layout file that defines the UI.
The user enters their weight and height in the respective text fields.
When the "Calculate BMI" button is clicked, the calculateBMI method in the BMIController class is triggered.
The BMI is calculated using the formula: BMI = weight / (height * height).
The result is displayed along with the classification based on the BMI value.
