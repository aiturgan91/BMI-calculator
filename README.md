## Project Overview
The BMI Calculator is a simple desktop application built using JavaFX. It allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) by inputting their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters). Once the user enters their data and clicks the "Calculate BMI" button, the application computes the BMI and displays the result along with a classification (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese). This project demonstrates basic JavaFX UI components, event handling, and BMI calculation logic.
